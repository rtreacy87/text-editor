  - Cut, copy, paste
  - Undo/redo
  - Find and replace
  - Line numbering
  - Word wrap
  - Multi-cursor editing

- **User Interface**
  - Menu bar with standard options
  - Status bar (cursor position, line count, etc.)
  - Customizable font and colors
  - Tab support for multiple open files

### 2.2 Advanced Features (For Later Iterations)
- Syntax highlighting for programming languages
- Auto-completion
- Code folding
- Split-pane view
- Plugin system
- Markdown preview
- Theme support
- Version control integration

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Design Pattern
The text editor will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:
- **Model**: Handles the text content and file operations
- **View**: Displays the text and UI components
- **Controller**: Processes user input and updates the model and view

### 3.2 Components

#### 3.2.1 Document Management
- File I/O handling
- Document state tracking
- Buffer management for large files

#### 3.2.2 Text Rendering
- Text display
- Cursor management
- Selection handling

#### 3.2.3 Command System
- Implementation of all editing operations
- Command history for undo/redo

#### 3.2.4 User Interface
- Main window
- Menus and toolbars
- Dialog boxes (save, open, find, etc.)
- Settings management

## 4. Technology Stack

### 4.1 Language Options
- **Python** + **Tkinter/PyQt/wxPython** (quick development, cross-platform)
- **Java** + **Swing/JavaFX** (robust, cross-platform)
- **C++** + **Qt** (high performance, cross-platform)
- **JavaScript** + **Electron** (for web and desktop deployment)

### 4.2 Libraries & Frameworks
Based on chosen language:
- Text rendering libraries
- UI toolkits
- File system APIs

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Basic UI layout
- File open/save operations
- Simple text editing capabilities

### 5.2 Phase 2: Enhanced Editing
- Implement undo/redo
- Find and replace
- Line numbering and status bar

### 5.3 Phase 3: UI Improvements
- Tab management
- Settings for appearance
- Keyboard shortcuts

### 5.4 Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion
- Additional features based on user feedback

## 6. User Interface Design

### 6.1 Main Window Layout
```
+----------------------------------------------+
| File  Edit  View  Help                       |
+----------------------------------------------+
| [Tab1] [Tab2] [Tab3]                         |
+----------------------------------------------+
|                                              |
|                                              |
|              Text Area                       |
|                                              |
|                                              |
+----------------------------------------------+
| Line: 1  Col: 1  Words: 0  Chars: 0  UTF-8   |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

### 6.2 Key UI Components
- Menu bar
- Tab bar
- Text editing area
- Status bar

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Performance
- Efficient text rendering for large files
- Background threading for file I/O
- Memory management for large documents

### 7.2 Extensibility
- Well-defined interfaces for future extensions
- Configuration system for user preferences
- Potential plugin architecture

### 7.3 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for UI components
- User testing for UX validation

## 8. Development Roadmap
